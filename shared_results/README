gauss-density* - 
	"dens_ave" contains the average density for each of the two gaussians
	"q" contains the local density at each point
	by "density" we mean the distance to the 15th nearest neighbor
		(which is k-16 in Marilyn's code, k=15 in Libby's and Jesses')
gauss-hubness* - 
	"N_k" contains the hubness score (k-occurrences, filename gives k)
	"hubs" contains a 0 or 1 for each point, 1 if this point is a 
		2-sigma hub
	"xdens_yhubs" contains the average density per cluster in the first column and the 		fraction of hubs in each cluster to the total number of hubs in the second 		column
unif-density* - same as gauss-density but for uniform hypercubes
unif-hubness* - same as gauss-hubness but for uniform hypercubes

Created by Libby:
gaussian_global_hubnesses.mat - 
	for example, "g_1_5_30_globalhubness_k5" contains the global 
	hubness score for each point in the synthetic two-gaussians
	data with 1000 points in the first cluster, 5000 points in the
	second, in 30 dimensions, with hubness calculated using k=5.
uniform_global_hubnesses.mat -  
	for example, "u_1_5_30_globalhubness_k5" contains the global 
	hubness score for each point in the synthetic two-uniforms
	data with 1000 points in the first cluster, 5000 points in the
	second, in 30 dimensions, with hubness calculated using k=5.
