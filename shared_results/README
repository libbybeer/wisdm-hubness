gauss-density* - 
	"dens_ave" contains the average density for each of the two gaussians
	"q" contains the local density at each point
	by "density" we mean the distance to the 15th nearest neighbor
		(which is k-16 in Marilyn's code, k=15 in Libby's and Jesses')
gauss-hubness* - 
	"N_k" contains the hubness score (k-occurrences, filename gives k)
	"hubs" contains a 0 or 1 for each point, 1 if this point is a 
		2-sigma hub
	"xdens_yhubs" contains ?
unif-density* - same as gauss-density but for uniform hypercubes
unif-hubness* - same as gauss-hubness but for uniform hypercubes
