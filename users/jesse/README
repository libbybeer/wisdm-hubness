Work from WiSDM at ICERM, July 2017

* analyzeSynthData.R
Script to analyze synthetic data created by Libby & Marilyn.
Creates contents of rankeddistances and graphs directories.


* rankeddistances
matrix of distances between all points, converted into ranks
so that I can more easily compute hubness for any value of k later.

* graphs: 
folder containing, for each synthetic data set made by
Libby and Marilyn, histograms of distances between
- all points
- all hubs
- all intrA-cluster hubs
- all intER-cluster hubs
